### **Exam Structure:**

The exam is divided into two main components:

1. **Lab Environment**:
    - You will be provided with a virtual environment containing various systems, including Linux and Windows hosts, such as Windows servers acting as Domain Controllers.
    - Your objective is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within this environment to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Lab Questions**:
    - After compromising the environment, you will answer 45 questions related to your activities and findings during the penetration test.

The exam is to be completed within **24 hours**, and you are required to submit your answers to the questions within this timeframe. Unlike previous versions, there is no requirement to submit a detailed report of your activities and findings.

### **Exam Objectives:**

1. **Information Gathering & Reconnaissance (10%)**:
    - Perform host discovery and port scanning on target networks.
    - Enumerate information from services running on open ports.
2. **Initial Access (15%)**:
    - Perform username enumeration to identify valid user accounts on target systems.
    - Perform password spraying attacks to identify valid credentials for initial access.
    - Perform brute-force attacks on remote access services for initial access.
3. **Web Application Penetration Testing (15%)**:
    - Perform web application enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    - Identify and exploit common web application vulnerabilities for initial access (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, command injection).
    - Perform brute-force attacks against login forms.
    - Exploit vulnerable and outdated web application components.
    - Exfiltrate data and credentials from compromised web applications and databases.
4. **Exploitation & Post-Exploitation (25%)**:
    - Identify and exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in services.
    - Identify and exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    - Dump and crack password hashes.
    - Identify insecurely stored credentials.
5. **Exploit Development (5%)**:
    - Develop or modify exploit code for initial access and post-exploitation.
    - Identify and exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities (e.g., stack overflow, buffer overflow).
6. **Active Directory Penetration Testing (30%)**:
    - Perform information gathering on Active Directory.
    - Perform enumeration attacks on Active Directory.
    - Exploit Active Directory vulnerabilities.
    - Perform privilege escalation attacks in Active Directory.
    - Perform lateral movement attacks in Active Directory.
    - Perform persistence attacks in Active Directory.
    - Perform data exfiltration attacks in Active Directory.

ðŸ‘‰ ### Personal Tips for Success

> This certification, in my experience, presents a medium-to-high difficulty level, especially if you are not familiar with Active Directory (AD). The exam focuses significantly on AD exploitation techniques, making it essential to have a solid understanding of AD environments. To enhance your preparation, engaging with platforms like [**GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD) (Game of Active Directory)** can be highly beneficial. GOAD provides a vulnerable AD environment, ideal for practicing common attack techniques. Detailed documentation and guides on tackling GOAD challenges are available on Mayfly277's website. Additionally, platforms such as **Hack The Box** offer practical labs that can be extremely useful. Specifically, the machines **SAUNA**, **ACTIVE**, and **TIMELAPSE** are designed to practice AD exploitation techniques. These labs allow you to refine your skills in a controlled and challenging environment. Another valuable resource is the mind map provided by Orange Cyberdefense, which offers a clear overview of AD penetration testing techniques. This mind map will help you visualize the various phases and tools necessary to approach the exam successfully. https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/ocd-mindmaps/
